  <h1>How BYTECLAN V1 Was Made</h1>
  <p><strong>BYTECLAN V1</strong> is a script fully developed by <strong>ByteBandit_ofici</strong> (also known as MiguelCriadorDeScript on GitHub).</p>
  <p>The entire code was written from scratch, based on personal knowledge and some research done through forums, YouTube videos, and the official Roblox API documentation.</p>
  <p>No pre-made or copied scripts were used. Every function was tested, refined, and organized using a custom system called <code>FunctionManager</code>, built from the ground up to make adding new features easier.</p>
  <p>The project is intended for educational and experimental use, especially for members of the coolkid community and Roblox scripting enthusiasts.</p>
